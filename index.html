                <p>This project is a data visualization solution for Massachusetts Promise Fellowship (MPF).
                    It focuses on two primary factors: the number of classes and service sites taken/served by MPF
                    Fellows, and their
                    evaluation of their experience as MPF Fellows in multiple dimensions (such as professional
                    development
                    and self-growth). The visualization aims to highlight the relationship between these two factors.
                    This
                    information will be extracted from data provided by MPF that their alumnus have filled out on a
                    survey.</p>
                <p>The goal of this project is to use feedbacks from previous alumnus to provide insights for MPF that
                    can assist with their recruitment
                    efforts and plans for improving their
                    program. These insights can potentially be extrapolated to the parent organization AmeriCorps to
                    further inform their overall programming. </p>

            <div class="box">
                <p>The primary dataset used in this project was the De-Identified Survey Responses from Alumnus for
                    2020.
                    This dataset provided a detailed understanding of alumus' MPF experiences and feedbacks during the
                    classes/years
                    they served at MPF.
                </p>
                <p>There were a wide variety of challenges that were present when cleaning a dataset like this. Here are
                    a subset of the steps taken to
                    improve these datasets. First, we needed to parse the time data into a consistent format that could
                    be plotted as datetime objects,
                    rather than a string. The next step was to convert some of the categorical data into ordinal data.
                    For example, ordering values from
                    Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree as ordinal instead of the categorical format it was presented
                    in. In other words, it would make sense
                    that Neutral would lie between these values.</p>
                <p>The next type of data encountered in bulk was text-based data originating from the written feedbacks
                    from alumnus.
                    In order to meaningfully utilize these feedback, each response was mapped to a corresponding
                    sentiment score. Traditional data cleaning steps for text data, such as Tokenization, removing stop
                    words, and etc. were utilized.</p>
                <p>Other issues encountered in the data cleaning process included handling a significant quantity of
                    NaN values. In a Machine Learning setting, it would make sense to simply impute these
                    values. However, this could be
                    misleading in a data visualization setting, so these values were relegated to a
                    separate category. Additionally, there were
                    some alumni survey responses that were duplicates and had to be removed. The sites served were also
                    manually inputted by the Alums filling
                    out the response so they had to be parsed (if served more than one location) and cleaned so that
                    different names referring to the same site
                    are grouped together. Similarly, the classes/years served by alumnus were also grouped together and
                    had to be seperated in order
                    to be used in the visualization. </p>

            <div class="box">

                <p> For our final visualization, we decided to create a word cloud linked
                    to a stacked bar chart that can be filtered by various MPF experiences. The terms used in the word
                    cloud orignated from
                    the written feedback given by the alumnus in their survey responses. The size of each word reflect
                    how often
                    the word was mentioned by all the alumnus. The binned colors used in the word cloud represent the
                    range of sentiment scores
                    of each word with words that have a more positive sentiment darker. The stacked bar chart below
                    represents the alumnus
                    survey responses for their MPF experience throughout the various class/year served. </p>
                <p>The design process started with rough sketches by each teammate. Then a finalized digital sketch was
                    created to mimic the final
                    result of the visualization. Some design choices include using binned colors for the word cloud for
                    easier
                    identification of words with different sentiment scores. The stacked bar chart is designed to have
                    proportions of
                    how many Alumnus rated an experience instead of actual counts for easier comparison between the
                    different class the
                    Alumni served. </p>

            <div class="box">
                <p>The word cloud was designed to utilize the size channel and color channel to encode both the number
                    of
                    occurances of the term and its setiment value, which allows the user to immediatetly see which terms
                    have been
                    mentioned the most. The sentiment value (a number between 0 and 1) of a term is the tendency of that
                    term to appear in sentences with a positive connotations. The higher the number, the more positive
                    the term.

                </p>
                <p>As mentioned previously, a stacked bar chart is used to allow a more direct
                    comparison between
                    each class/year served by alumnus. This can allow the user to more easily compare the various MPF
                    experiences year
                    over year. The stacked bar chart also uses the color channel to clearly differentiate between the
                    percentage
                    of various ratings for each MPF experience. The package used for coding is mainly D3.js libary.</p>
                <h3>How to Interact with the Visualization</h3>
                <p> The stacked bar chart can be filtered
                    by different experiences with the dropdown menu. The stacked bar chart can be additionally filtered
                    by clicking on words in the
                    word cloud above. Similarly, a bar can be clicked to look at the corresponding words for that
                    class/year
                    in the word cloud. </p>

                    feedback for MPF was overwhelmingly positive. The vast majority of terms used had
                    either positive or neutral sentiment. There were a couple terms that initially
                    appeared negative (e.g. ‚ÄúTraumatic‚Äù) that were filtered out as they were actually
                    being referred to in a positive light (i.e. "starting a career in helping those with
                    Traumatic brain injuries"). The words with neutral sentiment were filtered out resulting in a
                    Word Cloud of the most popular terms.

                <h3 class="is-size-5"> MPF Experience</h3>
                <p> By analyzing the stacked bar chart, alumnus tends to respond more positively (higher agreement
                    level)
                    when asked about MPF experiences that are more directly related to the work they are performing at
                    MPF such
                    as Mentor Young People and Professional Development. The experiences that has the lowest agreement
                    level
                    tend to be those that are less likely to be directly impacted by the work performed. Such as
                    Self-care and Self-worth.
                    There also does not seem to have a clear trend between the various classes/year served and the MPF
                    experiences.

            <div class="box">

                <p>In conclusion, most alumni have reported a positive experience by indicating they ‚ÄúStrongly Agree‚Äù or
                    ‚ÄúAgree‚Äù with their MPF experience survey questions. Additionally, MPF experiences had
                    the most positive responses when the experience is directly related to the work the alumnus
                    performed and more dispersed with experiences that are more related to
                    individual development of the fellows. Improvements/future-work would include further refining the
                    word cloud
                    and adding an option to show not only the positive feedback terms but also terms that might have a
                    more negative
                    setiment to it. This can allow further analysis to possibly identify areas of improvement.
